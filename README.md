## Automation with GitHub Actions

Automate your investments using GitHub Actions. The workflow is set to run monthly at 7:15 AM UTC on the 1st.

    - Under **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**, add:
        - `MERCADO_BITCOIN_API_ID`
        - `MERCADO_BITCOIN_API_SECRET`

2. **Set Repository Variables**

    - Under **Variables**, add:
        - `SYMBOL` (e.g., `BTC`)
        - `CURRENCY` (e.g., `BRL`)
        - `COST` (e.g., `100`)

3. **Customize Workflow (Optional)**

## Creating a Fully Automated Flow

To create a seamless, fully automated investment process, follow these steps:

1. **Schedule Monthly PIX Transfers**

    - Set up recurring PIX payments in your bank app to Mercado Bitcoin, ensuring the amount and timing align with Satoshi‚Äôs investment schedule.

2. **Integrate with Satoshi**

    - Synchronize transfer dates a day before the automated investment runs, monitor transactions, and update settings if investment amounts change.

3. **Ensure Security and Reliability**
    - Enable transaction notifications, securely store API credentials, and perform test runs to confirm the automated system works smoothly.

This setup allows Satoshi to automatically invest your monthly funds, growing your crypto portfolio effortlessly.
