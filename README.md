## Automation with GitHub Actions

Automate your investments using GitHub Actions. The workflow is set to run monthly at 7:15 AM UTC on the 1st.

1. **Add Secrets to GitHub Repository**

    - Navigate to your repository settings.
    - Under **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**, add:
        - `MERCADO_BITCOIN_API_ID`
        - `MERCADO_BITCOIN_API_SECRET`

2. **Set Repository Variables**

    - Under **Variables**, add:
        - `SYMBOL` (e.g., `BTC`)
        - `CURRENCY` (e.g., `BRL`)
        - `COST` (e.g., `100`)

3. **Customize Workflow (Optional)**

    - Modify [`.github/workflows/automated_monthly_investment.yml`](.github/workflows/automated_monthly_investment.yml) to adjust the schedule or parameters.

## Creating a Fully Automated Flow

To create a seamless, fully automated investment process, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up PIX Transfer Scheduling in Your Bank App**

    - **Access Your Bank‚Äôs PIX Scheduling Feature:**
        - Open your bank‚Äôs mobile app or online banking portal.
        - Navigate to the PIX transfer section.
    - **Schedule Recurring PIX Transfers:**
        - Set up a recurring monthly PIX transfer to your Mercado Bitcoin account.
        - Ensure the transfer amount matches your investment parameters in the Satoshi project (e.g., BRL 100).
        - Confirm the transfer details and schedule the date and time to align with the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., a day before the investment script runs).

2. **Integrate PIX Transfers with Satoshi‚Äôs Automated Workflow**

    - **Synchronize Transfer Timing:**
        - Schedule PIX transfers to occur a day before the GitHub Actions workflow executes to ensure funds are available for investment.
    - **Monitor Transactions:**
        - Regularly check both your bank app and Mercado Bitcoin account to ensure transfers and investments are processed successfully.
    - **Adjust Parameters as Needed:**
        - If you change your investment amount, update both the PIX transfer and the Satoshi configuration to maintain consistency.

3. **Enhance Security and Reliability**

    - **Enable Notifications:**
        - Set up notifications for both PIX transfers and Mercado Bitcoin investments to stay informed about each transaction.
    - **Backup API Credentials:**
        - Securely store your Mercado Bitcoin API credentials and regularly update them to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Test the Workflow:**
        - Perform a manual test run to ensure that PIX transfers and automated investments work seamlessly together.

By combining PIX's reliable transfer scheduling with Satoshi's automated investment workflow, you can create a hands-free system that ensures your cryptocurrency portfolio grows consistently every month.
